# temp-repo
The git branch is divided into a main branch and a new branch. The reason for dividing is to solve this problem by creating a new branch separately because problems may occur due to errors that may occur when developing new functions in the main branch.
Software is developed in a new branch, and when it is completed, it goes through several discussions through a pull request, and when it passes, it merges with the main branch.
When making a pull request, green indicates that something has been added, and red indicates that something has been removed.
